# TITLE: Predicting Home Run Leader for 2021 MLB Season
## Team Members: Samuel Connor Black and Yates Robinson
## Date: October 22, 2020

# Project Description
## Probelm Statement and Motivation
This project aims to predict the Home Run Leader for the MLB in the next year according to previous yearsâ€™ player statistics to have a better idea of which player will lead the league. Growing up playing baseball and watching the MLB has interested us since we were kids and wish to develop a closer understanding of player growth and predictions. These predictive models could potentially net us money based on selling this predictive solution to professional sports networks or betting companies.

## Introduction and Description of Data
Every year the Home Run Leader title is a hotly contested title as many of the best players in the league attempt to take the crown. Along with this a lot of people tend to bet on this statistic and predict who at the end of the season will have the most home runs. This problem is somewhat challenging as baseball is often very unpredictable and almost anyone having a hot season can take the title. Given this unpredictability it becomes hard to bet on a player and win. Showing recent trends among the previous home run leaders and other relevant stats will graphically display how the predictive model comes up with the player who is most likely to win.

# Plan
Our plan to accomplish this prediction is to find the current longest active player in the MLB and based on that we will grab all data (batting average, home runs, games played, etc.) from that point forward for all current players in the MLB. Along with this we will get data of all past home run title winners to create a baseline for stats of a home run title winner. With our current player data we will find the trend for each player and predict their stats in all for the 2021 MLB season. Using the baseline generated from past title winners, we will be able to see which players, based on prediction, have the best chance of winning the title in the 2021 season and how many home runs they will hit. <br>
